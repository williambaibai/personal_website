## Taking a break

If you're here, I just first want to say thanks for taking the time to visit. Like many around me, I often feel swallowed up by the unrelenting progression of life. We seem to go about our daily lives caring more about moving forward than about where we are going, and we rarely stop to look back at the steps we take. 

So that gave me some important reasons to create this blog: to verbalize my introspection and reflection, to pause and look both backward and forward in life, and to simply find an outlet to share the thoughts that come to me. 

##  A milestone

Personal blogs and websites have often been stigmatized to being LinkedIn pages, GitHub galleries, or even just glorified resumes. While those components are in this website, I hope that it's my writing that sets this website apart.  

## About myself

I am a student studying Computer Science at Cornell University. Al

Forcing myself to sit down and write something honest that other people can read turns out to be, well, pretty fun.
